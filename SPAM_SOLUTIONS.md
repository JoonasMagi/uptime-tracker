# Email Deliverability Troubleshooting Guide

Your Mailgun domain `up.eerovallistu.site` is properly verified with DNS records, but emails are still going to spam. Here are the solutions to improve deliverability:

## 🔍 Current Status
- ✅ DNS Records: Properly configured
- ✅ Domain Verification: Mailgun verified
- ✅ DKIM: Configured
- ✅ SPF: Configured
- ✅ DMARC: Configured
- ⚠️ Deliverability: Going to spam

## 🎯 Primary Solutions

### 1. Domain Warm-up (Most Important)
**Issue**: New domains have no sender reputation
**Solution**: Gradually increase sending volume

```bash
# Start with low volume for 2-3 weeks:
- Week 1: 10-50 emails/day
- Week 2: 50-100 emails/day  
- Week 3: 100-500 emails/day
- Week 4+: Normal volume
```

### 2. Use Your Business Domain for FROM Address
**Current**: `eero.vallistu@vikk.ee` (different domain)
**Better**: `alerts@up.eerovallistu.site` (same domain)

**Why**: Email providers trust emails more when FROM domain matches sending domain.

#### To Fix This:
1. In Cloudflare, add an MX record for `up.eerovallistu.site` pointing to your email provider
2. Create email alias: `alerts@up.eerovallistu.site` → `eero.vallistu@vikk.ee`
3. Update configuration:

```bash
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=alerts@up.eerovallistu.site
```

### 3. Improve Email Content (Already Implemented)
- ✅ Professional subject lines
- ✅ Proper headers
- ✅ HTML + Text versions
- ✅ No spam trigger words

### 4. Add Email to Contacts/Whitelist
**Manual Fix**: Add `alerts@up.eerovallistu.site` to your email contacts
- This tells email providers the sender is trusted

### 5. Check Blacklists
Your IP might be blacklisted. Check at:

- Enter: `up.eerovallistu.site`

## 🚀 Quick Fixes to Try

### Option A: Use a Subdomain for Alerts
Create: `alerts@up.eerovallistu.site`

1. **In Cloudflare DNS**:
   ```
   Type: MX
   Name: up
   Content: 10 mx1.privateemail.com (or your email provider)
   ```

2. **In your email provider**: Create email forwarding
   `alerts@up.eerovallistu.site` → `eero.vallistu@vikk.ee`

3. **Update .env**:
   ```bash
   MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=alerts@up.eerovallistu.site
   ```

### Option B: Use a More Trusted FROM Name
Update to something more business-like:

```bash
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@up.eerovallistu.site
MAILGUN_FROM_NAME=Website Monitoring Service
```

Name: default._bimi.up
Content: v=BIMI1; l=https://yourdomain.com/logo.svg;
```

### 2. Monitor Reputation
- Check Google Postmaster Tools
- Monitor feedback loops
- Track bounce rates

## 🎯 Immediate Action Plan

1. **Change FROM email** to use your domain
2. **Add to contacts** manually
3. **Send fewer emails** initially (domain warm-up)
4. **Test with mail-tester.com**
5. **Monitor Mailgun analytics**

## 📧 Expected Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Some emails may still go to spam
- **Week 3-4**: Deliverability should improve significantly
- **Month 2+**: Should have good reputation if following best practices

## ⚠️ Red Flags to Avoid
- Don't send high volume immediately
- Don't use spam trigger words in subject/content
- Don't send to purchased email lists
- Don't ignore bounces/complaints
