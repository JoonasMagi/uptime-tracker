# Email Deliverability Improvement Guide

Your emails are going to spam because new domains need to establish sender reputation and implement proper email authentication. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔍 Current Issues

1. **New Domain**: `up.eerovallistu.site` has no sender reputation
2. **Missing SPF Record**: Not found in your DNS
3. **Email Content**: May trigger spam filters
4. **Domain Warming**: Need to gradually increase send volume

## 🛠️ Step 1: Add Missing DNS Records

Add these DNS records to your domain `eerovallistu.site`:

### SPF Record (Critical)
```
Type: TXT
Name: up.eerovallistu.site (or just "up" if it's a subdomain)
Value: "v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all"
TTL: Auto
```

### DKIM Record (Already have this - good!)
Your DKIM is already configured correctly.

### DMARC Record (Recommended)
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc.up.eerovallistu.site
Value: "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:eero.vallistu@vikk.ee; pct=100"
TTL: Auto
```

## 🔧 Step 2: Improve Email Content

I'll update your email templates to be less spam-trigger-prone.

## ⚡ Step 3: Domain Warming Strategy

1. **Start Small**: Send 10-50 emails per day initially
2. **Gradual Increase**: Double volume weekly
3. **Monitor Reputation**: Check Mailgun analytics
4. **Avoid Spam Words**: Update email content

## 📧 Step 4: Alternative Solutions

If spam issues persist:

1. **Use Your Main Domain**: Instead of subdomain, use `eerovallistu.site`
2. **Professional Email Provider**: Consider Google Workspace or Microsoft 365
3. **Mailgun Shared IP**: You're likely on shared IP which may have reputation issues

## 🔍 Step 5: Test Email Deliverability

Use these tools to test:
- mail-tester.com
- Google Postmaster Tools
